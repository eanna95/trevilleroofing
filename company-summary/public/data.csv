RAFTRx Roofing + Exteriors,,"{""grade"":""C"",""summary"":""RAFTRx receives a C grade due to several factors that prevent it from achieving the highest investment grade. While the company demonstrates aggressive growth through acquisitions and has expanded to 13 states since its 2023 founding, it lacks the 5-year revenue growth history required for an A grade (founded only in 2023). The company appears to be of sufficient size to accommodate a $10 million investment given its multi-state presence and acquisition strategy. However, there are strong indicators that RAFTRx may already be backed by private equity - it was established as a 'multi-regional platform' which is typical PE terminology, and its rapid roll-up acquisition strategy is characteristic of PE-backed companies. The company's industry reputation cannot be fully assessed from the available information, though its expansion and acquisition success suggests reasonable market acceptance.

LAST CALL ROOFING INC,,"{""grade"":""F"",""summary"":""Last Call Roofing, INC receives an F grade due to insufficient information to evaluate any of the key investment criteria. The available data shows only basic company information - it's a roofing contractor in Fort Myers, Florida that is not BBB accredited. Critically missing is: (1) Any financial data or revenue information, let alone 5-year growth trends, (2) Company size metrics to assess if it could accommodate a $10M capital allocation, (3) Current ownership structure to determine if already PE-backed, and (4) Limited reputation indicators beyond non-accreditation with BBB. Without access to financials, growth metrics, or ownership information, this company cannot be properly evaluated for private equity investment and therefore receives a failing grade."",""citations"":[""https://www.lastcallroofing.com/"",""http://members.bia.net/list/Member/last-call-roofing-inc-2777"",""https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/fort-myers/profile/roofing-consultants/last-call-roofing-inc-0653-90443905""]}","[{""metric_name"":""est_annual_revenue"",""metric"":""Unknown"",""details"":""No financial information available in search results"",""citations"":[]},{""metric_name"":""est_yoy_growth"",""metric"":""Unknown"",""details"":""No year-over-year revenue growth information found in initial search results"",""citations"":[]},{""metric_name"":""can_accommodate_allocation"",""metric"":""Unknown"",""details"":""No information regarding company size to accommodate a $10 million capital allocation was found"",""citations"":[]},{""metric_name"":""company_size"",""metric"":""Unknown"",""details"":""Company size information not available in search results"",""citations"":[]},{""metric_name"":""pe_backed"",""metric"":false,""details"":""No information found indicating the company is backed by another private equity firm"",""citations"":[]},{""metric_name"":""reputation"",""metric"":""C"",""details"":""Company is not BBB Accredited Business, which suggests average reputation"",""citations"":[""https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/fort-myers/profile/roofing-consultants/last-call-roofing-inc-0653-90443905""]}]",https://www.lastcallroofing.com/,"[{""position"":""Founder"",""first_name"":""Oscar"",""last_name"":""Villegas"",""citations"":[""https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscar-villegas-807110114"",""https://www.saleshandy.com/people/oscar-villegas-email-phone-150552584""]},{""position"":""CEO"",""first_name"":""Oscar"",""last_name"":""Villegas"",""citations"":[""https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscar-villegas-807110114"",""https://www.saleshandy.com/people/oscar-villegas-email-phone-150552584""]}]",0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,31155
Pressure Point Roofing,OR,"{""grade"":""D"",""summary"":""Pressure Point Roofing Inc. receives a D grade due to insufficient information and concerns about size relative to the $10 million capital requirement. While the company showed strong 30% growth from 2017 to 2018 (reaching $6.3 million in revenue), there is no data available for the subsequent years through 2023, making it impossible to assess recent performance or current revenue levels. Even with optimistic growth assumptions, the company would likely still be too small to comfortably accommodate a $10 million capital allocation, as this would represent more than their entire 2018 revenue. On the positive side, the company has a good industry reputation with multiple awards (Duro-Last Elite Contractor, Chairman's Award, Owens Corning Platinum Preferred Contractor) and experienced leadership with Matt Stone owning multiple businesses. There is no indication of current PE ownership, which meets that criterion. However, the lack of recent financial data and small size relative to investment requirements significantly limit its investment grade."",""citations"":[""https://www.roofingcontractor.com/articles/93107-contractor-profile-pressure-point-roofing-inc"",""https://pressurepointroofing.com/about-us/awards/"",""https://pressurepointroofing.com/team/matt-stone/"",""https://www.stoneheatair.com/team/matt-stone/""]}","[{""metric_name"":""est_annual_revenue"",""metric"":""$6.3 million"",""details"":""Last reported revenue was $6.3 million in 2018, current revenue likely higher but unknown"",""citations"":[""https://www.roofingcontractor.com/articles/93107-contractor-profile-pressure-point-roofing-inc""]},{""metric_name"":""est_yoy_growth"",""metric"":""30%"",""details"":""Reported 30% growth in 2018 compared to previous year, recent growth rates unknown"",""citations"":[""https://www.roofingcontractor.com/articles/93107-contractor-profile-pressure-point-roofing-inc""]},{""metric_name"":""can_accommodate_allocation"",""metric"":false,""details"":""Based on 2018 revenue of $6.3M, would need significant growth to accommodate $10M allocation without current financial data"",""citations"":[""https://www.roofingcontractor.com/articles/93107-contractor-profile-pressure-point-roofing-inc""]},{""metric_name"":""company_size"",""metric"":""Small-Medium"",""details"":""Multi-location regional roofing contractor with $6.3M revenue as of 2018, expanded to Eugene location"",""citations"":[""https://www.roofingcontractor.com/articles/93107-contractor-profile-pressure-point-roofing-inc""]},{""metric_name"":""pe_backed"",""metric"":false,""details"":""No information available suggesting private equity backing, appears to be owner-operated by Matt Stone"",""citations"":[""https://pressurepointroofing.com/team/matt-stone/""]},{""metric_name"":""reputation"",""metric"":""B+"",""details"":""Strong industry recognition with Duro-Last Elite Contractor status, Chairman's Award, and Owens Corning Platinum Preferred Contractor designation"",""citations"":[""https://pressurepointroofing.com/about-us/awards/""]}]",https://pressurepointroofing.com/,"[{""position"":""President"",""first_name"":""Matt"",""last_name"":""Stone"",""email"":""mattstone@pressurepointroofing.com"",""citations"":[""https://pressurepointroofing.com/blog/team/"",""https://pressurepointroofing.com/team/matt-stone/"",""https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-stone-28000885""]},{""position"":""Founder"",""first_name"":""Matt"",""last_name"":""Stone"",""email"":""mattstone@pressurepointroofing.com"",""citations"":[""https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-stone-17795b2a""]},{""position"":""CEO"",""first_name"":""Matt"",""last_name"":""Stone"",""email"":""mattstone@pressurepointroofing.com"",""citations"":[""https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-stone-17795b2a""]},{""position"":""Vice President"",""first_name"":""Brian"",""last_name"":""Fisher"",""citations"":[""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-fisher-78272113""]}]",35,0,41,45,49,77871,0,85076,91740,98674
