Stronghouse Solutions,TX,"{""grade"":""F"",""summary"":""Stronghouse Solutions fails to meet the key criteria for an A grade investment. Most critically, the company is already owned by O2 Investment Partners, a private equity firm, which automatically disqualifies it from receiving an A grade per the stated requirements.

While the recent executive appointments (CEO Russ Reynolds and CRO Troy Baker) and the partnership with Infinity Roofing & Siding suggest growth ambitions, these moves alone cannot overcome the fundamental disqualification of existing PE ownership.
